            I love all sorts of cheeses, baguettes, lasagna, but the most important to me is omelettes. Oh and I also like hummus. And oreos. I think I really like food.

            I love video game music. I'm listening to the Trackmania United soundtrack
             as I write this. I like VG soundtracks such as Breath of the Wild,
              most Mario games such as Mario Kart Wii or New Super Mario Bros., Splatoon,
               Super Monkey Ball 2, Euro Truck Simulator 2, and Art of Balance ((underrated game alert!)).

            At start i wanted this site to be modifiable and optimized as in have an HTML template
            and slap Markdown pages in a folder and call it a day but the only way I could do that 
            was through some Ruby implementation and it was super confusing so I basically gave up,
            and so this site is entirely written by hand in html.

            I'm a big fan of the Backrooms and liminal spaces. Though I don't like the recent mainstream about the Backrooms and their whole Wiki that includes entities, dangers, colonies and whatnot.
            I think it ruins the liminality and sense of loneliness that originally gave its charm.

            I collect discord emotes and I've made quite a few servers solely for Nitro subscribers 
            to have a ton of little images to send or scroll when they're bored! There's categories and all!
            You can find it on the #emotes channel on my main <a tabindex="0" target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/8tQ6cPd">Discord server</a>.

            I like Super Mario 64 rom hacks. I kinda wanted to try making one but I never had any idea on what to do or change.

            I like Rubik's cubes and I have a small collection of them ranging from all shapes and sizes.
            I've trained myself for speedcubing, and I can do a 3x3 in about 35 seconds. My PB is approx. 25.6s.
