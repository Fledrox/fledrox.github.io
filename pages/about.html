                    I'm a <span class="flag">French</span> student and a (soon!) video game design and game art student. 
                    My hobbies consist of drawing, making music, cooking, coding, 3d modelling and most importantly playing video games. 
                    I'm also learning Japanese on my own.

                    I'm a big fan of digital arts. I enjoy both 3D and 2D media, with a preference for cartoony styles. Do check my <a tabindex="0" href="../pages/portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>

                    My childhood was accompanied by comics like Gaston Lagaffe, The Rabbids, The Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk, and I drew a bit of (bad) comics. 
                    I had Pok√©mon Art Academy on the Nintendo 3DS before I had my first graphic tablet a few years ago.

                    I grew up with a Nintendo DS in hands. Naturally, I've always enjoyed video games. The Mario franchise has been a big part of it,
                    but I also love The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Minecraft and the Trackmania franchise.
                </p><p>
                    I like games with build in level editors and I enjoy tool assisted speedruns and glitches.
