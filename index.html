            Hi, I'm Fledrox
        </h1>
        <span class="text" id="presentation">
            I'm a French student in Architecture. My hobbies consist of drawing, making music, cooking, and of course, playing video games (PC master race LULW). I'm also learning Japanese by myself. Yoroshiku onegaishimas!
            <br \><br \>
            Let's start with the most common hobby. I was BORN AND RAISED with Mario games, especially New Super Mario Bros. and Mario Kart DS on my Nintendo DS lite. I still enjoy to this day Mario (and overall Nintendo) games. I'm super fond of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and I regularly play on Nintendo Switch. Though right now, I'm discovering TLoZ:Skyward's Sword HD. Now you did read the intro right, I am a PC gamer most of the time. As most gaymerzz do, I really like Minecraft. Funnily enough, I discovered it on Xbox 360, when I was 11. Another of my favorite games is the Trackmania franchise. That's probably the biggest reason I'm proud of France (where Nadeo and Ubisoft [respectively game studio and publisher] originated). My dad made me discovered it through Trackmania United Forever and I still play it to this day, but along with the TM², Trackmania Turbo and TM2020. I do enjoy racing games in general, I quite like the Forza Horizon series, TDU2, as well as driving in GTAV (I only play Story mode on that one. Ain't nobody got time for online).
            <br \><br \>
            I am kind of an audiophile and I have the gift of perfect pitch. I assume it's a family thing, since my grandpa played the oboe and English horn in an orchestra, my grandma was a flute teacher, my mom plays guitar and concert flute at times and my uncle plays trumpet in a band.
            <br \><br \>
            I went and did one and a half years of guitar classes, realizing guitar sucked and the lessons sucked too. I never really did music theory ("solfège" as we call it) and didn't do anything else related to music. I did have a battery at some point and still wish I did, I'd have so much fun. Though, I did enjoy playing other kinds of drums like the Darbuka, with other students after lunch in the music room when I was around 14.
            <br \><br \>
            While we're on the subject of music, the genres I enjoy are French house and kinda electronic music (such as Le Knight Club, Daft Punk), chiptune (early Dubmood albums), 80's pop/funk (Change) and samples/remixes (Flamingosis), vaporwave (Night Television), and at occasions Jazz or Classical music (Symphony No. 3 in E-Flat, Op. 55 ‘EROICA’: III. Scherzo & Trio: Allegro vivace do be groovin doe). I also quite enjoy certain video games soundtracks. Why won't Nintendo sell complete OSTs outside of Japan!!! (not talking about the copyright greed they have on YouTube too haha)
            <br \><br \>
            I have a thing (I think it's called HATRED) against modern pop/rap music and famous """singers""". Not being mean though! It takes skill to download and use a vocoder and a MIDI to FL-Studio converter. /S
            <br \><br \>
            I like food. I really like food. Especially stuff like pasta and bread. As a French person, yes, I love baguettes. Despite eating a lot (from what other people say anyway), I don't get fat. Not yet, that is.
            <br \><br \>
            I prefer salty stuff. Long live hummus, bless the gods of lasagna, and pray the holy cheeses.
            <br \><br \>
            As of recently, I've joined an architecture school! I've yet to discover it's wonders. I don't have anything else to say about it, so on a related note:
            <br \><br \>
            I like art, most particularly drawings, digital art. I have a tooth for cartoony styles and THICC mama girls. Since an image (or, well, many) speak a thousand words, I'll let this album on my Pinterest speak for itself.
            <br \><br \>
            Secondo io, the most important things about drawing are perspective and anatomy. As of now, I'm mostly doing figure drawing (with reference essentially) , especially women.
            <br \><br \>
            I'm French, I'm pretty fluent in English, I can speak Italian quite well and I only know basic stuff in Japanese. I've yet to learn all the kanjis, let alone remember flawlessly the hiraganas and katakanas (I can read them fine but writing them is hard).
