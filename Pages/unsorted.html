            I love all sorts of cheeses, baguettes, lasagna, but the most important to me is omelettes. Oh and I also like hummus. And oreos. Man I love food. If eating food and do nothing else was a job you can be sure I'd apply LOL

            I think I'm funny, but I also laugh at the weirdest stuff. Have you ever heard of Among Us gregory? I need you to vent. I know it will be hard for you to be sus but I know you can do it gregory.

            I love video game music. I'm listening to the Trackmania United soundtrack
             as I write this. I like VG soundtracks such as Breath of the Wild,
              most Mario games such as Mario Kart Wii or New Super Mario Bros., Splatoon,
               Super Monkey Ball 2, Euro Truck Simulator 2, and Art of Balance ((underrated game alert!)).

            I really like <a href="https://noclip.website">noclip.website</a>,
             because it lets you see how some game environments are made
              and lets you take screenshots you otherwise couldn't have taken in-game.
               Kinda lets you imagine how the 3d artists were at their studio and be like
                "hmm oh yeah im gonna make this bush by making a round thing
                 and slap transparent textures of leaves floating around it to give it a sense of depth."

            Yes, I <em>am</em> a furry.

            At start i wanted this site to be modifiable and optimized as in have an HTML template
            and slap Markdown pages in a folder and call it a day but the only way I could do that 
            was through some Ruby implementation and it was super confusing so I basically gave up,
            and so this site is entirely written by hand in html.

            I'm a big fan of the Backrooms and liminal spaces.
