                    <h2>Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a French student with the intent to study in video game design and game art.
                        My hobbies consist of drawing, making music, cooking, coding and most importantly playing video games.
                        I'm also learning Japanese by myself.

                    <h2>Art</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a big fan of digital arts. I enjoy both 3D and 2D media, with a preference for cartoony styles.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like spending my free time drawing, as well as 3D modelling. <a href="portfolio.html">Here's a small portfolio I made.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a kid, I was a huge fan of comics. Not the DC kind, more of the Gaston Lagaffe, Les Lapins Cr√©tins (The Rabbids) kind.
                        I did spend some time drawing some Rabbids comics. No I won't show them.

                    <h2>Games</h2>
                    <p>
                        My early childhood was primarly composed of Mario games, and I grew up with the Nintendo DS.
                        My taste for Nintendo games still haven't died off to this day,
                        though I do like exploring new genres. I've got a thing for indie games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As of now, my favorite games are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
                            <li>Minecraft</li>
                            <li>the Trackmania franchise</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>I've been playing Roblox lately as well as making some stuff in it! I'm currently trying to recreate the Breath of the Wild environment
                        starting from the Shrine of Resurrection, the place where you start the game.</p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy speedruns, especially TASes. They're really impressive when done right
                        and can exploit the most absurd bugs ever! (Search for Trackmania Noseboost, or SM64 Parallel Universes)<br />
                        I tried my hand on speedruns too! You can check out the run I did for the game Perfect Vermin <a target="_blank" href="https://www.speedrun.com/perfect_vermin/run/y66k9v1y">here</a> (I know, I know, it's not perfect).

                <h2>Music</h2>
                I am sort of an audiophile and I have relative perfect pitch.
                I assume it's a family thing since a lot of them including my mom, grandad and uncle play some music instruments.
                <br \><br \>
                I went and did one and a half years of guitar classes (which sucked). I do music on PC (FL Studio) and my wish for santa is an electric drumkit.
                <br \><br \>
                The genres I enjoy are French house, chiptune, 80's pop/funk beats and vaporwave / mallsoft.
                Here, I made a <a href="music.html" class="text link">selection of songs I like</a>.
                <br \><br \>
                I hate mainstream music. It only exists for the purpose of making money and it has no soul.
                <br \><br \>
                <h2>Food</h2>
                If I'm not gaming, I'm eating. I like eggs, cheese and bread the most. You can guess I'm a savoury kind of person.
                Hummus, lasagna, goat cheese, baguette, all this stuff is good for the soul.             
                <br \><br \>
                I am a fan of cooking videos, including Chef Michel Dumas, big icon of the French Youtube game.
                <br \><br \>
                Wow, you actually read all of this. Thanks for caring about me üëç
