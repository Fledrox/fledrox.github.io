                <h2>Me</h2>
                I'm a French student, currently in Architecture since recently. My hobbies consist of drawing, making music, cooking and playing video games.
                My coding skills mainly consist of Javascript. I'm also learning Japanese by myself. More about my hobbies:

                <h2>Art</h2>
                I enjoy art, especially digital art. I like cartoony styles, like in
                <a href="https://www.pinterest.fr/fledrox/art/girls-mostly/">this Pinterest album</a>.
                <br \><br \>
                <h2>Games</h2>
                My early childhood was primarly composed of Mario games, and I grew up with the Nintendo DS.
                My taste for Nintendo games still haven't died off to this day (though can't say the same about the company COUGH).
                As of now, my favorite games are:
                <ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>the Trackmania franchise</li>
                </ul>
                <br \><br \>
                <h2>Music</h2>
                I am sort of an audiophile and I have relative perfect pitch.
                I assume it's a family thing since a lot of them including my mom, grandad and uncle play some music instruments.
                <br \><br \>
                I went and did one and a half years of guitar classes (which sucked). I do music on PC (FL Studio) and my wish for santa is an electric drumkit.
                <br \><br \
                The genres I enjoy are French house, chiptune, 80's pop/funk beats and vaporwave / mallsoft.
                Here, I made a <a href="music.html" class="text link">selection of songs I like</a>.
                <br \><br \>
                I hate mainstream music. It only exists for the purpose of making money and it has no soul.
                <br \><br \>
                <h2>Food</h2>
                If I'm not gaming, I'm eating. I like eggs, cheese and bread the most. You can guess I'm a savoury kind of person.
                Hummus, lasagna, goat cheese, baguette, all this stuff is good for the soul.             
                <br \><br \>
                I am a fan of cooking videos, including Chef Michel Dumas, big icon of the French Youtube game.

                Wow, you actually read all of this. Thanks for caring about me üëç
