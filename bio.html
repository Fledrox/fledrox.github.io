                <h2>Me</h2>
                I'm a French student in Architecture. My hobbies consist of drawing, making music, cooking and playing video games.
                I'm also learning Japanese by myself.
                <br \><br \>
                I'm an Architecture student since recently. Since we're starting off with art:
                <br \><br \>
                <h2>Art</h2>
                I enjoy art, most particularly digital art. I have a sweet tooth for cartoony styles, and about my taste, I'll let
                <a href="https://www.pinterest.fr/fledrox/art/girls-mostly/">this album</a> speak for itself.
                <br \><br \>
                <h2>Games</h2>
                My early childhood was primarly composed of Mario games, especially New Super Mario Bros. and Mario Kart DS.
                My taste for Mario (and overall Nintendo) games still haven't died off to this day.
                I'm super fond of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and as of right now, I'm discovering TLoZ:Skyward's Sword HD.
                I also love Minecraft, Portal 2 and most of all the entirety of the Trackmania franchise.
                <br \><br \>
                <h2>Music</h2>
                I am sort of an audiophile and I have relative perfect pitch.
                I assume it's a family thing ; my grandpa played the oboe and English horn in an orchestra, my grandma was a flute teacher, my mom plays guitar and concert flute at times and my uncle plays trumpet in a band. You get it.
                <br \><br \>
                I went and did one and a half years of guitar classes, realizing guitar sucked and the lessons sucked too.
                I never really did music theory ("solfège" as we call it) and didn't do anything else related to music.
                I did have a drumkit at some point and still wish I did.
                <br \><br \>
                While we're on the subject of music, the genres I enjoy are French house and kinda electronic music (such as Le Knight Club, Daft Punk),
                chiptune (early Dubmood albums), 80's pop/funk (Change) and samples/remixes (Flamingosis), vaporwave (Night Television),
                and at occasions Jazz or Classical music (Symphony No. 3 in E-Flat, Op. 55 ‘EROICA’: III. Scherzo & Trio: Allegro vivace do be groovin doe).
                I did make a <a href="music.html" class="text link">list</a> of a selection of music tracks that I really like.
                <br \><br \>
                My most despised genre is modern pop and rap music, in fact, all music that has been made for the sole purpose of selling albums and streaming time.
                <br \><br \>
                I will try and learn the piano lately, despite only having a two-octave mini Arturia keyboard that my dad gave me.
                <br \><br \>
                <h2>Food</h2>
                I like food a lot, especially carbs and cheese. As a French person, yes, I do like baguettes. To be honest, I prefer salty stuff, even for the 4PM break.
                Long live hummus, bless the gods of lasagna, and pray the 7 holy cheeses.                
                <br \><br \>
                I am a fan of cooking videos. If I have to cite any channels, that'll be Chef Michel Dumas, an icon of the french Youtube overall and his videos are never boring.
                If you don't speak french, you can check out his son Jean-Paul Dumas, he does the same thing as his father but in english.
                I'll also mention Joshua Weissman for his nicely entertaining style, as well as LE RIZ JAUNE for being an underrated asian cuisine channel.
                <br \><br \>
                I don't think I have anything else to say, honestly.
